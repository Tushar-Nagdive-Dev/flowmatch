# 📘 FlowMatch - Smart Reconciliation Platform

---

## 🚀 Project Base Idea

> FlowMatch is a **Smart Invoicing and Payment Reconciliation Platform** designed to automate and simplify reconciliation workflows for businesses.  
> 
> It enables:
> - Smart Invoicing Management
> - Payment Reconciliation Tracking
> - User Management with Role based Access (USER, ADMIN, PAID, FREE)
> - Realtime Dashboard Analytics (Charts, Tables, Summaries)
> - SSR (Server Side Rendering) for better performance
> - Seamless Single Jar Production Deployment (Spring Boot + Angular)

Built with → **Spring Boot + Angular 17 + PostgreSQL + JWT + SSR (Universal)**

## 📦 Modules Overview

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Authentication + Authorization | JWT based login, register and secured APIs |
| User Management | Admin can manage users with roles and statuses |
| Invoices | Create, manage, view invoices |
| Reconciliation | View and track reconciliation history |
| Dashboard & Analytics | Visual charts and analytics |
| SSR & SEO Ready UI | Angular Universal based SSR support |
| Unified Build | Single JAR build via Spring Boot static folder for easy deploy |

---

## ✅ Completed So Far

✅ Backend Setup (Spring Boot, JWT, User / Role Management)  
✅ Frontend Setup (Angular 17 LTS + Standalone Components + MacOS inspired UI)  
✅ Authentication Flow (Login / Register + Guards)  
✅ SSR Setup (Angular Universal + server.ts based)  
✅ Unified Build System (Angular Build copied to Spring Boot → served from /static)  
✅ Master Automation Script (Dev Mode, SSR Mode, Spring Boot Combined Build)  
✅ Sidebar + Toolbar UI (Gradient Sidebar, MacOS inspired design, Notification icons)  
✅ Dashboard Page placeholder with welcome card

---

## 🚦 Next Steps (Phase 2 + 3)

### PHASE 2 → Dashboard + Page Components (Current Focus)

[ ] Install and Setup `ng2-charts` (Chart.js based library compatible with Angular 17)  
[ ] Add Pie Chart → Invoices status  
[ ] Add Bar Chart → Reconciliation trends  
[ ] Implement Invoices Table → Pagination + Sorting  
[ ] Implement Users Table → Show roles + user statuses  
[ ] Implement Reconciliation simple view

### PHASE 3 → Finalization & Production

[ ] Polish UI → Sidebar colors, hover states, active states  
[ ] Optimize Layout and spacing (macOS style final polish)  
[ ] Build Production SSR + Static + Unified JAR  
[ ] Prepare Deployment Plan (optional dockerization)

## 📌 Notes

- All required setup for DEV + SSR + Combined Build already done
- UI is modular and easily extendable
- We are ready to now make the Dashboard and other pages dynamic with real data + charts
- Once dashboard + pages done → project will be almost Production Ready

---

**✅ Ready to continue → Next planned step → Dashboard Chart + Table Setup.**

---

# 📌 How to continue

Once this is added to Project Mode:

Simply continue with:

> "Maya, continue with Phase 2 → Dashboard charts and tables"

I will automatically continue from there in clean and structured way (task by task).  
No need to repeat any configuration again.


Absolutely — this is the right mindset before you move to Project Mode →  
**Finalize and Freeze everything: vision, features, phases, scope.**  
So here is the final, crystal-clear version 👇

# 📘 FlowMatch — Smart Reconciliation Platform (Finalized Vision and Scope)

---

## 🎯 **Project Objective (What is FlowMatch?)**

FlowMatch is a **Smart Reconciliation Platform** designed to:

✅ Automate invoice management and payment reconciliation.  
✅ Provide intuitive dashboards for financial insights.  
✅ Give business users + admin users role-based access to powerful tools.  
✅ Simplify deployment by combining frontend (Angular) + backend (Spring Boot) into a single jar (Unified Build).  
✅ Support SEO and performance with Server Side Rendering (SSR).  
✅ Deliver a **macOS inspired, clean and attractive user interface**.  
✅ Provide developer-friendly project structure, modular code, and automated build + deploy processes.

---

## 🧩 **Planned Features and Modules**

### 1️⃣ User & Roles Management → (✅ DONE)

- User registration + login
- JWT based authentication + authorization
- Roles: USER, ADMIN, PAID_USER, FREE_USER (scalable)
- Guarded pages (with AuthGuard)

---

### 2️⃣ Smart Dashboard → (🚧 Next Phase)

- Welcome & status widgets
- Pie Chart → Invoices summary
- Bar Chart → Reconciliation trends
- Revenue, reconciliation, invoice overview
- (ng2-charts / chart.js will be used)

---

### 3️⃣ Invoices Management → (🚧 Phase 2 after Dashboard)

- List view (Angular Material Table)
- Pagination + Sorting + Filtering
- Invoice creation (optional in future phase)
- View Invoice details

---

### 4️⃣ Reconciliation Module → (🚧 Phase 2 after Invoices)

- Can be extended to show notifications like successful reconciliation, new invoices etc

---

### 7️⃣ Unified Build + SSR → (✅ DONE)

- SSR enabled (SEO + social sharing ready)
- Unified build → Angular built → copied to Spring Boot `static/`
- Single JAR file deployment → reduces cost + easy deploy (no separate node server required)

---

## 📈 Future Advanced Scope (Optional for later phases)

> (Not current scope but possible next levels)

- Multi-org / Tenant support

# ✅ Final Words → Project Direction Locked

> Everything is now finalized and clean.

✅ You can now move to Project Mode  
✅ Start from "Phase 2 → Dashboard Page"  
✅ Proceed till Phase 3 (Finalization)

After that → this will be ready for **Real Production or Demo Deploy**.

---

If you want → I can generate the **FINAL PROJECT SUMMARY PDF or MD format** too for keeping in repo (Recommended for future team members).

Just say:

> "Yes Maya, generate Project Summary PDF / MD"

And I will generate a beautiful export version for documentation & sharing (repo / email / slack / project management).
